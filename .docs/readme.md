# Docs / temporary

For the next 10 days I suggest that Hans tracks Muris' progress in this way: Hans documents Muris' code.
In the same way Hans will start to describe Components, general SPECs and requirements that guide the implementation within .docs.

Partly we can communicate in Q-A-style, partly Muris can leave in-code-comments or start in-MD-documentation.
But the main-focus of Muris should be the building-process, no worries about how to document it exactly.

Hans will work on this using Obsidian and copy-pasting content here. As Obsidian uses quite clean Markdown it should be a pleasure for Muris to collaborate on it simple within VS Code.

After 5-7 days -once we have worked the first wave- Hans will migrate the .docs into the general task-management + documentation on the crearis-system that he is building on Obsidian. This will be included into the repo as gh-submodule and directly accessible and editable within the code-base and allows for a documentation that works cross-repo.
